<p>The programmer is a man who writes the hundred of lines of code every day. Normal people can't understand what it takes to write that much code. The program is the thing that makes us alive. Even one code can ruin our whole day.</p><br/>

<p>Most of my friends know I am very new in the coding world. But I learn many things that I can write in this article. I have done much research on how to do concentrate on programing you are writing. And here are some tips for you guys.</p><br/>

<h3>Don't try to learn all the thing at once</h3>
<p>It is just a bad idea to learn all the things at once. If you try to do it you there is just little chance you learn it or remember it for long. It is better to learn just one language at once. So your brain gets time to prosses it. If you try to thick also to how many languages you have to learn, You can get overwhelmed or demotivated by the fact that how many languages you have to learn. Just sit down and think that "I have to just learn this language. Even it takes a whole year to learn." This will defiantly give you the motivation to learn.</p><br/>

<h3>Start small</h3>
<p>You have to learn it every day, not just one time. <i>Programing language is a game more you practice it better you become, but if stop playing the game you will forget how to play game</i>. I use <a href="http://www.tomato.es/" target="_blank">pormodro timer</a> to do more code. I just sit and do the work for 2 hours(a full Pomodoro session). But you don't need to sit 2 hours at the start you can just to 25 mins(a first Pomodoro session) or maybe less. You just need to sit.</h6><br/>

<h3>Learn the language you like or If you don't know which to learn to start with easy ones</h3>
<p>In my case I learn the language that I like. I tried to start with easy ones they are languages that I did not interest in so I can't learn them. But then I started with which one I liked the most and it worked I learned it. But if you don't know which one to start just start with <a href="https://blockgeeks.com/guides/programming-languages/" target="_blank">easy ones</a>. This way you can get confidence and motivation to learn more programming languages.</p><br/>

<h3>Don't quit when it becomes hard</h3>
<p>I also guilty of this. Don't quit when it becomes hard. It will take time to learn it. You will learn it. After some time it well and absolute become easy to you.</p><br/>

<h3>Pratice while you are learning it</h3>
<p>If you learn from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Absolute-Beginners-Guide-3rd/dp/0789751984" target="_blank">books</a> like me. Then it is better to learn while you are praticeing. In this way you will remember what a code is do. And you will remenber it better.</p><br/>

<h3>Start early</h3>
<p>The more early you start better it is. The learning programming language takes a lot of time. It takes 10000 hours to master something. If you want to start your career if programming then starts now.</p><br/>

<h3>Listening the songs</h3>
I don't know but it is easy for me to concentrate while listening to <a href="http://www.tomato.es/users/5e016654a814d90006d4efea" target="_blank">songs</a>. Don't listen to any song but soft ones which can help you concentrate. But some people have a problem with learning while listening to songs. The choice is up to you.
