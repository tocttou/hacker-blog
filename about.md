I am a [longtermist](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/longtermism) that thinks we're at the [hinge of history](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/hinge-of-history). I am trying to make a plan whose successful execution will ensure humanity survives the deployment of powerful AI systems. I'm involved in the [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/) and [rationality](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/d922gAtBM8JNzkKKJ/p/xhQxJ7WSZZRkzNZJ8) communities.

I subscribe to [Crocker's rules](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/crockers-rules); leave me anonymous feedback [here](https://www.admonymous.co/mark). My resume is located [here](/downloads/resume.pdf). RSS feed for this blog is located [here](https://markxu.com/atom.xml).
